2013/06/09: Version 2.0.0b1
---------------------------

The 13th alpha of phpDocumentor contains the final functionality for version 2.0.
A lot of effort has been put in making sure that the API, Object structure and plugin mechanism will remain
backwards compatible until version 3.0.

Features have been changed, removed and added; making this an incredibly large backwards compatibility break compared
to 2.0.0a13.

> Important: if you have written your own XSL based template; please change the template.xml to generate the XML output
> first by adding a transformation with the XmlAst writer. Please look at our existing templates for an example.

> Important: please open an issue for every broken piece of functionality. We have taken the utmost care not to
> introduce bugs but due to large change some might occur.

In the following list we have tried to exhaustively document the list of changes and their impact. Due to the size of
the refactoring it is nigh impossible to make a 100% accurate list. Please contact us if you have questions; the website
https://www.phpdoc.org describes various methods.
