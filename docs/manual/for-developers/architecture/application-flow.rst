Application flow
================

A typical execution flow happens in two stages,

#. The given project's source code is *parsed* and broken down into a light-weight representation (Descriptors).
#. The light-weight representation (Descriptors) are *transformed* using a series of transformations in a template into
   a consumable artifact.
